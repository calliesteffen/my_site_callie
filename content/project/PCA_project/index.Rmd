#Introduction: PCA of USDA Food Group: Eggs and Dairy Products


This Principle Component Analysis (PCA) explores relationships of nutrient variables of Dairy and Egg Products based off data from the United States Department of Agriculture. By performing a PCA, we can simplify the dimensions of the data while still explaining a majority of the variance

#Data Cleaning for Analysis 
```{r, results= FALSE}

#Interested in exploring the food group of dairy and eggs, so will filter data for that food group and differnt nutrient aspects

dairy_df <- usda %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  filter(food_group == c("Dairy and Egg Products")) %>% 
  select(food_group,protein_g,sugar_g,fat_g,carb_g,energy_kcal,fiber_g)

#Exploring any NAs
summary(dairy_df)
skim(dairy_df)
gg_miss_var(dairy_df)

# No missing values


```

#Analysis: Running PCA on Dairy Data
```{r, echo=T, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,fig.show='hide'}

#pca
dairy_pca <- prcomp(dairy_df[2:7], scale = TRUE)

dairy_pca

summary(dairy_pca)
##my frist two PC explain ~69% of data 

 
plot(dairy_pca) #shows variance

biplot(dairy_pca) #looks messy


```

Between Principle Component 1 and Principle Component 2, ~69% of variance is captured. This simplifies the the number of dimensions, and by only using 2 of the 6 Principle Components (axes) we are still able to explain over half of the variance of the data.

#Visualize with ggfortify for a cleaner graph
dairy_biplot <- autoplot(dairy_pca, 
                      colour = NA,
                      loadings.label = TRUE,
                      loadings.label.size = 4,
                      loadings.label.colour = "black",
                      loadings.label.repel = TRUE) +

Angles between the vectors will tell you how much each characteristics correlate with each other. 



* Protein and Fat are positively correlated 
* Sugar and carbs are highly positively correlated 
* There is almost no correlation between sugar and energy_kcal
* Fiber and fat are negatively correlated
