#Introduction: Snowshoe Hare Analysis of Age, Weight, and Sex

This project contains an analysis of age, weight, and sex of captured Snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) in Tanna Valley, Alaska. The study used the capture-recapture method from 1999-2002. Snowshoe hares experience population fluctuations of 8-11 years and are recognized as a keystone species in northern boreal forests.

#Data Cleaning for Analysis
```{r,echo=TRUE, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}


#Cleaning data to only keep SEX AGE WEIGHT and for age only keep Juvenile (j) and Adult (A), and for sex only keep (m) and (f)

hare_new <- hare %>% 
  select(sex, age, weight) %>% 
  drop_na(sex) %>% 
  drop_na(age) %>% 
  drop_na(weight) %>% 
  filter(sex=="m" | sex=="f") %>% 
  filter(age=="a" | age=="j") %>% 
  mutate(age = ifelse(age == "a", "Adult", "Juvenile")) %>% 
  mutate(sex= ifelse(sex=="m","Male" ,"Female"))

#Visualizing Hare Data
```{r, fig.cap="Figure 1. Male and Female Hares: Age and Weight on Capture/Recapture from 1999-2002. Age is measured by juvenile and adult and weight is measured in grams."}

jitter_hare <-ggplot(data=hare_new, aes(x=age, y=weight), textsize=1) +
  geom_jitter(
    aes(color = age,
        pch = age)
  ) +
  facet_wrap(~sex) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0), limits=c(0, 2000), breaks = seq(0,2000, 200)) +
   labs(y="Weight (grams) ", x="Age") +
  theme (panel.grid.major = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        panel.background = element_blank(), axis.line = element_line(colour = "black"), plot.title = element_text(face="bold")) +
  ggtitle("Male and Female Hare Weight for Juveniles and Adults") +
   scale_color_manual(values = c("Adult" = "red", "Juvenile" = "black"))

####The scatterplot is a nice way to visualize the weight of juvenile and adult snowshoe hares for both males and females in order to see which sex generally weighs more at both life stages.

#Summary Statistics for Age, Sex, and Weight of Hares
```{r}


hare_counts <- hare_new %>% 
  group_by(age) %>% 
  count(sex) 

hare_mean <- hare_new %>% 
  group_by(age, sex) %>% 
  mutate(mean_weight = mean(weight)) %>% 
  group_by(age, mean_weight) %>% 
  count(sex) %>% 
  select(age,sex,mean_weight,n)


table_hare <- kable(hare_mean, caption ="Table 1. Age, Sex, and Mean Weight of Snowshoe Hares in Tanna Valley, Alaska from 1999-2002.", col.names = c("Age","Sex","Mean Weight","Sample Size")) %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"))
 

table_hare  

```


####From this table we can infer that as adults, female Snow Hares tend to weigh more than males, but as juveniles males tend to weigh more.
