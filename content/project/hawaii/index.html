<h1>Introduction:</h1>
<p>This analysis will explore land use and watersheds for the big island of Hawaii. The land use and land cover data was primarily based on the interpretation of aerial photography from the 1970’s and 1980’s, with secondary sources including land use maps and surveys. Watersheds are shown for the 8 major islands and measured in square miles.</p>
<p>See metadata (linked below) for specific watershed names and more detailed descriptions of what is included in the 7 categories of land cover.</p>
